# Siobhan's Team Fortress
This mod plans to restore all post-release cut content, including the infamous Civilian, Cut weapons, and some other underrated things, such as Raid Mode, Creep Wave, and some other fun stuff.
While this mod aims for the 'restore all post-release cut content' direction, there may be quality of life changes, too.
